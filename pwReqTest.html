			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>The important parts of this widget are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Only the first password field references the list of requirements using <code>aria-describedby</code></li>
				<li>“Met” and “Unmet” only change when the criteria becomes met, or unmet.</li>
				<li>Each list item is like:  <code>&lt;li aria-live=”polite” artia-atomic=”true”&gt;</code>.  <code>aria-live=”polite”</code> makes a screen reader read out the contents when there’s a change, and <code>aria-atomic=”true”</code> makes the screen reader read out the whole line, not just “met” or “unmet”.  Note that each list item needs to be its own live region.  If the whole widget is a live region, then the whole list gets read out whenever there’s a change.  You don’t want that.</li>

Then as I type a password when a met/unmet changes, that requirement is read out <em>twice!</em>, followed by the entire password requirements section.  Example after typing the first uppcase letter: "Bullet Uppercase letter met.  Bullet Uppercase letter met.  Your password must contain at least...."</dd>

Then as I type a password when a met/unmet changes, that requirement is read out, but the statuses of all requirements are read out in their initial state.

					<h4>Narrator</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>Firefox 100</dt>
						<dd>Does not read out the requirements when focus lands on the password input.  It should.  Then it doesn't read out <em>any</em> of the criteria as they become met or unmet.  Total failure.</dd>
						<dt>Edge 102</dt>
						<dd>Does not read out the requirements when focus lands on the password input.  It should.  Then it gets funny.  As I type in a password, starting with a capital letter I hear "End of line selected" (at this point the blue focus indicator moves to the label of "Confirm password".) then it continues "1 uppercase letter met 3 of 6 level 1."</dd>
						<dt>Chrome 101</dt>
						<dd>Does not read out the requirements when focus lands on the password input.  It should.  Then it only reads out the changed part, ignoring <code>aria-atomic</code>.  Example: when you type the first capital letter it reads "met closing parenthesis"</dd>
						<dt>Internet Explorer 11</dt>
						<dd>Does not read out the requirements when focus lands on the password input.  It should.  Then as you type, it reads out the criteria as they're met/unmet.  Example: when you type the first capital letter it reads "1 uppercase letter met, 3 of 6 1 uppercase letter met closing parenthesis".</dd>

					<h4>NVDA 2017.4</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>Firefox 55</dt>
						<dd>Reads the criteria as they're met/unmet, as it should be.</dd>
						<dt>Firefox 60</dt>
						<dd>Reads the criteria as they're met/unmet, as it should be.</dd>
						<dt>Firefox 63</dt>
						<dd>Reads the criteria as they're met/unmet, as it should be.</dd>
						<dt>Internet Explorer 11</dt>
						<dd>Reads out the criteria as they're met/unmet, but reads out "met" or "unmet" as it was <em>before</em> the change.  Example: when you type the first capital letter it reads "Bullet 1 uppercase letter unmet".  If you hit backspace to delete that character, the "met" changes to "unmet", and NVDA reads "Bullet 1 uppercase letter met".</dd>
					</dl>

				<section>
					<h4>JAWS 18</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>Firefox 55</dt>
						<dd>It just says "star".  Nothing about the requirements.</dd>
						<dt>Firefox 60</dt>
						<dd>Reads the characters as you enter them.  Nothing about the requirements.  Note that <code>aria-describedby</code> isn't being read.</dd>
						<dt>Firefox 63</dt>
						<dd>Reads the characters as you enter them.  Nothing about the requirements.  Note that <code>aria-describedby</code> isn't being read.</dd>
						<dt>Opera 51</dt>
						<dd>JAWS does not read the <code>aria-describedby</code> text but tells you to press <kbd>JAWS Key+Alt+R</kbd> to hear descriptive text.  <kbd>Insert+Alt+R</kbd> does not work.  However, once you start typing in a password, once there's a change in the list (ie: a requirement changing from "unmet" to "met") the whole list is read out again.  Except when you type the same password into the second field.  Then when the "Passwords must match" changes from "unmet" to "met", JAWS doesn't read out any of the list.</dd>
						<dt>Internet Explorer 11</dt>
						<dd>Reads out the whole list when field recieves focus, as desired.  When you put the first character in, it re-reads the whole 
list, then reads out the one thing that's changed. For example if you type "P" it will read the whole list and "1 Uppercase letter met".  Then if you type "a" it will just read "1 lowercase letter met".</dd>

						<dd>VO only reads "Your password must contain at least".  It does not read the list.  As requirements are met/unmet, VO reads out the change as it should, followed by "Your password must contain at least".</dd>
						<dt>Firefox 101</dt>
						<dd>VO reads the password requirements as it should. As requirements are met VO reads "bullet" twice followed by the new status.  Then, sometimes, it reads the entire requirements section again.  Example after typing the first uppercase letter it reads "Bullet bullet one uppercase letter met.  Your massword must contain at least....".  Then if I type a lowercase letter it reads "Bullet bullet one lowercase letter met."</dd>

					<h4>Mac OS X 10.9.5</h4>

						<dd>VO reads the password requirements as it should.  But as you type in a password, VO reads nothing.</dd>
						<dt>Firefox 61</dt>
						<dd>VO does not read anything on this page, no the contents, not the labels.  Nothing.</dd>
						<dt>Firefox 62, and 63</dt>
						<dd>When I try to run Firefox (Dev edition or Nightly) at the same time as VoiceOver, Firefox crashes.</dd>
						<dt>Chrome</dt>
						<dd>VO reads the password requirements as it should.  Whenever a character is typed, VO reads it as "bullet".  If you have 5 characters typed in, it reads "bullet" 5 times.  Then, when one of the requirements becomes met, it does read that as it should. When you delete a character and a requirement becomes unmet, it reads that too, as it should.</dd>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>NVDA+Firefox or JAWS+Internet Explorer 11 work best.  NVDA+Opera and JAWS+Firefox don't work at all.  Works well enough on iOS. VoiceOver of Mac OS X 10.9.5 really only works as it should in Chrome and Opera, and almost in Firefox. Perhaps I need to upgrade my Mac OS.</p>
			<p>UPDATED: <time>2022-06-07</time>:  It seems that when an input is <code>aria-describedby</code> a section that updates dynamically, most stacks will read out the entire described region.  Perhaps, instead of a live region, each item was separately descrbed, like with <a href="pwReqTest-2.html">Example 2</a>?  Nope, turns out that's not ideal either.</p>
			<p>In Windows it seems that whenever <em>one</em> thing changes that describes an input, all of that input's descriptors are read out again.  And on Apple systems, it's not the case.  This could be a nightmare.  The only good way I can think of doing this is having a live region that only lists what's changed, and after 1 keystroke, remove the <code>aria-describedby</code> from the input, then re-attach it on blur.</p>
			<p>UPDATE <time>2022-06-09</time>:  I think I have finished a <a href="pwReqTest-3.html">working example</a>.</p>
			<h3>Recommendations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>It would be good to put the password requirements before the password fields rather than after.</li>
