    <h1>Accessible Password Requirement Home Page</h1>
    <p>When creating an account on a site, sometimes you have to create a password that meets certain requirements.  As you type in a password, and those requirements are met, a list of requirements may be updated dynamically.  I wanted a way to do this in an accessible manner.  This is what I came up with.</p>
    <p>But it still needs some work.</p>
