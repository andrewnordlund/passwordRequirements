				<h2>Notes</h2>
				<p>The important parts of this widget are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Only the first password field references the list of requirements using <code>aria-describedby</code></li>
					<li>“Met” and “Unmet” only change when the criteria becomes met, or unmet.</li>
					<li>Each list item is like:  <code>&lt;li aria-live=”polite” artia-atomic=”true”&gt;</code>.  <code>aria-live=”polite”</code> makes a screen reader read out the contents when there’s a change, and <code>aria-atomic=”true”</code> makes the screen reader read out the whole line, not just “met” or “unmet”.  Note that each list item needs to be its own live region.  If the whole widget is a live region, then the whole list gets read out whenever there’s a change.  You don’t want that.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<section>
				<h2>Screen Reader results</h2>
				<p>In the above, I have the widget demo'd in French and English.  In English, the list of requirements comes after the password inputs.  In French it comes before.  In English, the status of the requirements are exposed to screen readers after the requirement (Ex: "At least 1 uppercase letter. Met").  In French, they come before (Ex: "<span lang="fr">Remplie : Au moins 1 lettre majuscule</span>"). In both languages, the status is a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> nested inside the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> that has the requirement.  In English, the <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> is referenced by the first password input with <code>aria-describedby</code> to demonstrate that you can still use <code>aria-describedby</code> and this widget won't override your values - only add to them.</p>
				<p>The following tests will be done and results listed below:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Top to Bottom</dt>
					<dd>Read through the page top to bottom (<kbd>Insert+Down</kbd> in NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator. <kbd>Control+option+Right</kbd> in VoiceOver OS X, swipe-right in VoiceOver iOS.) to check if the list of requirements is read as a list, if each requirement is listed with its status.</dd>
					<dt>Bit by Bit</dt>
					<dd>Read through the page line by line, item by item. (<kbd>Down</kbd> in NVDA and JAWS.  <kbd>Insert+Right</kbd> in Narrator. <kbd>Control+option+right arrow key</kbd> in VoiceOver OS X, swipe-right in VoiceOver iOS.)  This <em>shouldn't</em> give different results than Top to Bottom.  If it never does, I'll just stop tracking, and erase this.  Else, differences will be noted.</dd>
					<dt>Focusing</dt>
					<dd>When the first password field takes focus, are all elements referenced by <code>aria-describdedby</code> read out, including the <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> in the English widget, the phrase "All passwords must contain", and each criteria along with their status?</dd>
					<dt>Typying</dt>
					<dd>As you type, when requirements are met or unmet is the change announced?  Does the announcement include both the requirement and its <em>new</em> status?</dd>
					<dt>Re-typing</dt>
					<dd>If you type a few characters, then <kbd>Shift+Home</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Back</kbd> to select the whole password, then delete and start again, all requiremtns should be set to their initial state, then they should change as they're met/unmet as you type more characters.  I'll type "P-a-s-s" to change the status for Uppercase, Lowercase, and no two letters consecutively..  Then Select-all -&gt; Delete -&gt; retype the same thing.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>Each will have notes about support and behavior.  Here's what they mean:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt class="full-support">Full support</dt>
					<dd>Everything works as it should, including <code>lang</code> attributes.  A screen reader user shouldn't experience any barriers beyond the inherent complixity of the process.</dd>
					<dt class="most-support">Mostly supported</dt>
					<dd>Most things will work as they should, but there may be something that's not right which could be part of how the screen reader and/or operating system work, such as not respecting the <code>lang</code> attributes.  My results could be because I don't have French properly downloaded or installed on my OS or SR.  But this is mostly an edge case.</dd>
					<dt class="partial-support">Partial support</dd>
					<dd>Some aspects work.  Some don't.  A screen reader user may be able to find workarounds, for example if not all password requirements are read in a top-down reading, but they are when the input takes focus.</dd>
					<dt class="no-support">No support</dt>
					<dd>Not a thing in that test works.  A screen reader user will face a signifiant barrier.  The thing just doesn't work.</dd>
					<dt class="odd-behavior">Odd behavior</dt>
					<dd>This is for things that made me go "hmmmmm". Like if the screen reader only reads part of a list item; or reads it twice or thrice.</dd>
					<dt class="not-applicable">N/A</dt>
					<dd>Not Applicable.  Due to a limitation in the system (or my skills), this test couldn't be performed.</dd>

Then when it's done reading the last list item, it goes back and re-reads the list starting with the first list item.  Then at the second list item, after it reads out the requirement, it goes back and re-reads the second half of the requirement and the status  Ex: "Passwords must match unmet.  At least 8 characters met. A maximum of 10 characters. Of 10 characters met. At least 1 lowercase letter unmet. 1 lowercase letter unmet."

Note that when you do get to the list, if you wait for a second or two VoiceOver reads out instructions about navigating the list.  Okay, things have just gotten funny.  In playing with this, now VoiceOver keeps reading the list when it gets to it.  It doesn't stop.  I have no idea what's going on. Mostly supported with odd behavior.</dd>

									<dd>Most is fine, but each list item is treated as two parts: the requirement, and the status. When you <kbd>Control+Option+right</kbd> to the first requirement, it reads out the requirement and position (ex: "At least 8 characters 1 of 10") then you need to <kbd>Control+Option+Right</kbd> to hear "Unmet".  Then when you get to the French part, it reads out all French text in a French accent.  Full support</dd>
									<dt class="full-support">Focusing</dt>
									<dd>The name, role, and value are all read.  Then it reads all descriptions including each requirement and its status as it should.  In French, everything is read with a strong English accent. Full support.</dd>
									<dt class="full-support">Typying</dt>
									<dd>As I type, changed requirements are read out along with their new status.  Full support.</dd>
									<dt class="most-supported odd-behavior">Re-typing</dt>
									<dd>When I select everything and delete it, it seems like it's trying to read all changes out, but only says one. ("At least 1 uppercase letter unmet.")  Then as I start typing again, the requirements are read out as their status changes, but the status itself is only read out if it was not announced in the deletion process.  When I retype "P" I hear "At least one uppercase letter met".  But then when I type "a" I hear "At least one lowercase letter".  When I type "s-s" I hear "No two characters the same consecutively".  But if I type a "!" I hear "At least one special character met".  Then if press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> as statii changes, their requirement along with their new status is read out.  Mostly supported with odd behavior.</dd>

									<dd>Everything is fine.  When you get to the list elements, it reads each requirment with its status and position in the list.  Ex: "At least 8 characters unmet 1 of 10."  Same with the French.  Note that it still reads all French in a strong English accent.  Mostly supported.</dd>

									<dd>It reads properly all the way down. However, most French is read out in a strong English accent, with the exceptions of <span lang="fr">En Français</span>, "Submit", and "Code", which it reads as French.  It's as though anything added after page-load has its <code>lang</code> attribute ignored.  Note that Chrome is the only one that reads out everything referenced by <code>aria-describedby</code> in a Top-to-Bottom scan.  The others only read that out when the input takes focus.  Mostly supported with odd behavior.</dd>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>This works as expected in most browser, OS, and screen reader combos, except Narrator, which seems to have issues with <code>aria-describedby</code>, with one exception:  If the Narrator setting "Hear advanced detail, like help text, on buttons and other controls" is turned on, then the <code>aria-describedby</code> part is consistently read in Edge only.  Also, Internet Explorer has reached end of life, so don't worry about it.</p>
				<p>This is pretty robust in Windows, except with Narrator with any non-Edge browser.  This works in iOS 14.  And there are a couple of issues with VoiceOver in Catalina.  As usual, Safari works best overall with VoiceOver.</p>
